I know that my project is incomplete, but I wanted to submit what I have so far since today is the deadline. 

I have been having a difficult time with this project. I have watched the Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTLM5 Canvas classes. I have watched the office hours for this project, attended a 1:1 help session, and read through all the community posts related to this project, as well as the supplementary project materials provided by Udacity. 

A lot of the other code snippets people post on the community forum seem to be pretty advanced. I haven’t seen anything like it in any of the Udacity courses. I’m assuming they are doing external research to supplement the Udacity material. If you can provide any guidance or direction for what my next steps should be, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!
